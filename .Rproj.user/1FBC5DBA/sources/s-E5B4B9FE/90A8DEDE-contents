# About museR and the repository structure

This repository contains the package museR that I began work on for my undergraduate thesis at Reed College. The text of my thesis is found in the thesis.pdf file. 

Since I have continued to work on this package after graduation, I have created a branch named thesisVersion which is the work I completed my senior year, along with other material more relevant to my thesis than this package, such as my oral defenxe presentation.
